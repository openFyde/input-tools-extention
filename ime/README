# Chrome OS IME

Chrome OS IME is JS-based IME for various languages which runs in
Chrome OS.

## Requirements

* [Closure Compiler](https://code.google.com/p/closure-compiler/)
* [Closure Library](https://code.google.com/p/closure-library/)

## How to build

Set up these environment vairbles:

* `CLOSURE_COMPILER` to the closure compiler binary.
  e.g. /home/<USER>/closure-compiler/compiler.jar
* `CLOSURE_LIB` to the closure library root.
  e.g. /home/<USER>/closure-library

Then run this under "pinyin" folder:

    make

And you will find the folder `files` generated, in which the compiled JS files
and manifest are generated, as well as the tar.gz extension package of pinyin
for Chrome OS.

And run this under "zhuyin" folder:

    make

And you will find the folder `files` generated, in which the compiled JS files
and manifest are generated, as well as the tar.gz extension package of zhuyin
for Chrome OS.
